### Hi, I am Felipewithf ðŸ‘‹ 

Born in Colombia, raised in Canada, I am an Award winning designer, currently working for a healthcare technology company in Toronto. I have been working hard on learning all the tools and tech stacks to allow me add interactivity to my own designs!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on as a Design & Experience Lead at Surgical Safety Techonolgies.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently on route to become a full stack developer.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything related to blockchain, sports or inclusivity.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about design principles, soccer, human behaviour or restaurants in Toronto.
